## Projects


### Kaggle Machine Learning 
![Screenshot 2024-07-28 000558](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e742083-aed9-4b9b-af00-55a5de45b301) 


A machine learning model was built to predict ratings of medications based on information from medication review. Text mining and exploratory graph analysis were used to preprocess and develop topics from text. Emoxicon and sentiment analysis were used to compute emotions and sentiments available in the review. Finally, transformer scores were used to analyse sentiment and compute probability of review belonging to 'Satisfication' classes, and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spines was used to train model. Root Mean Squared Error was used to test the performance of the model. The primary language in this project was R. 


### Data Analysis Of Palmer Archipelago Penguins

An independent analysis in R of Antarctic penguins, summarizing data on species, sex, culmen length and depth, flipper length, body mass, and island in Palmer Archipelago. This project included data cleaning, exploratory analysis, visualization, regression(simple and logistic),and classification(K Nearest Neighbor).

American high school students take SATs, standardized tests that had three sections - reading, math, and writing, each with a maximum score of 800 points(2400 total). These tests serve an important role in the admission process for students and colleges alike. However, does where you live affect scores?

A multiple regression analysis was conducted to predict APGAR(Activity, Pulse, Grimace, Appearance, Respiration) scores from birthweight, gestastional age, and maternal weight gain.
