American high school students take SATs, standardized tests that had three sections - reading, math, and writing, each with a maximum score of 800 points(2400 total). These tests serve an important role in the admission process for students and colleges alike. However, does where you live affect scores?

An data driven album API built using created data from MySql. This API has endpoints for a static view and an endpoint that filters data by id. Python, Gitpod, GitHub, and MySql were involved in creating this project. All documentation can be found [here](https://github.com/cann-emma/fastapi-demo-fork/blob/main/app/main.py).
