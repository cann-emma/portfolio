## Projects

### Kaggle Machine Learning 

![Screenshot 2024-07-28 000558](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1e742083-aed9-4b9b-af00-55a5de45b301) 


A machine learning model was built to predict ratings of medications based on information from medication review. Text mining and exploratory graph analysis were used to preprocess and develop topics from text. Emoxicon and sentiment analysis were used to compute emotions and sentiments available in the review. Finally, transformer scores were used to analyse sentiment and compute probability of review belonging to 'Satisfication' classes, and Multivariate Adaptive Regression Spines was used to train model. Root Mean Squared Error was used to test the performance of the model. The primary language in this project was R. 


### Predicting Box Office Success: Enhancing Accuracy with Keyword Analysis

The project analyzed box office success using text data from movie keywords to identify patterns associated with high revenue. Keyword data was preprocessed and tokenized, machine learning models were then built to predict success based on keyword features. Results highlighted the importance of specific themes and genres in driving box office performance, offering insights for content strategy and marketing.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/132afbba-420d-4438-a201-439c53d1a143)

A time series analysis was conducted to examine the relationship between COVID-19 deaths and vaccination rates, utilizing cross-correlation functions, Granger causality, and Pearsonâ€™s correlation. The project involved thorough planning, including setting clear objectives, defining methodologies, and establishing a timeline for deliverables. Collaboration with two other team members ensured tasks were divided efficiently, with regular check-ins to align progress. [Time Series](https://github.com/carolinehagood/covid-project)

An image classification project was completed using a convolutional neural network (CNN) to classify visual data into predefined categories. The process involved data preprocessing, feature extraction, model training, and evaluation to optimize accuracy. [Image Analysis](https://github.com/carolinehagood/ds4002-project3)

### Taylor Swift Lyrics Topic, Sentiment, and Emotional analysis

![Resilience_Year_meancomp](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45d8e51d-f276-413d-a7c7-e91150cfc6d0)

The Taylor Swift lyric analysis project examines the evolution of emotions like confidence and resilience in her lyrics over time. Sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and statistical analysis through wilcoxon test were used to examine emotional shifts across years. The findings revealed a significant increase in emotions such as confidence and resilience in her more recent songs, suggesting a shift in her personal narrative and songwriting style.

An independent analysis in R of Antarctic penguins, summarizing data on species, sex, culmen length and depth, flipper length, body mass, and island in Palmer Archipelago. This project included data cleaning, exploratory analysis, visualization, regression(simple and logistic),and classification(K Nearest Neighbor).

### Analysis of Mean SAT Score By New York City Borough

![scantron-56a946695f9b58b7d0f9d809](https://github.com/Cann-Emma/portfolio/assets/143144256/b8e3a8be-9260-4d5e-8649-ff486975655d)


A one-way Analysis of Variance test was used to determine whether there was a significant difference in the average total Score on the SAT among students in four boroughs of New York City(Bronx, Brooklyn, Queens, and Manhattan). R + Python were used in this project to describe, visualize, transform and reshape data, as well as, perform hypothesis testing.

### APGAR Multiple Regression Analysis

![Newborn-screening-in-Canada](https://github.com/Cann-Emma/portfolio/assets/143144256/403e96b8-f9c6-4757-837a-ca869a3d2aa9)


A multiple regression analysis was conducted to predict APGAR(Activity, Pulse, Grimace, Appearance, Respiration) scores from birthweight, gestastional age, and maternal weight gain. R was used to summarize, visualize, check statistical assumptions, and perform significance testing.
